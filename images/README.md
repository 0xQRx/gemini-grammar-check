# Extension Icons

This directory contains the icon files for the VS Code extension.

## Requirements

- icon.png: 128x128 PNG icon for the VS Code marketplace
- Other sizes can be included for different contexts

## Creating Icons

To create a proper icon:
1. Design a 128x128 PNG image
2. Use the Gemini color palette (blue #4285F4, green #0F9D58, yellow #F4B400, red #EA4335)
3. Ensure it's clear even when scaled down
4. Save in PNG format (SVG is not supported for extension icons)

Place your icon.png file in this directory to replace the placeholder.
